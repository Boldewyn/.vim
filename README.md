# Boldewyn’s `~/.vim` Folder

## Peculiarities

I use my vim almost exclusively from a dedicated `screen(1)` window. In
most cases, this will not be of interest for you, if you use this
configuration, but keep it in mind, especially when you’re a gVim user.

## Installation

In a terminal go to your home folder, make sure there is _no_ `.vim` folder,
as it might otherwise be clobbered, and clone this repo:

    ~ $ git clone https://github.com/Boldewyn/.vim.git

The repo comes bundled with a `.vimrc` file:

    ~ $ ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc

Now you’re ready to use Vim just like me :)
